# Friend Finder

*Georgia Tech's Coding Bootcamp Week 13 Homework*

A compatibility-based "friend finder" application -- basically, a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Friend Finder is a Node app that uses Express to handle routing.
